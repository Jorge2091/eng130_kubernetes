# Kubernetes

kubernetes has frown for a 173% bigger in indeed jobs. on top of this, it is used by 69% of all other container control service. <br/>
The way we can activate kubernetes in windows by going to the docker Desktop and going to settings and then kubernetes and make sure it is enabled <br/>

The download of the kubernetes if not yet enabled before or installed before, would take a few minutes, no more than 10mins.
To see if we have install or enabled kubernetes correctly, we can go to our terminal and with admin mode, run the command `kubectl` and we should receive a post as shown below.


```
kubectl controls the Kubernetes cluster manager.

## applying node app with kubernetes

<img src="./images/node.png"/>
similar to deploying nginx docker with kubernetes, we can do the same with our node app, all we have to do is change the nginx image or our node image and make sure port 3000 is being listened.
in a new yaml file, we can write

```Yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1 # which api to use for deployment
kind: Deployment # What lind of service/object you want to create
# What would you like to call it - name service/object
metadata: 
  name: node-deployment # naming the deployment

spec: 
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: node_app # look for this label to match with k8 service
  # let's create a replica set of this with instance/pods
  replicas: 3
  # template to use it's label for k8 service to launch in the browser
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: node_app # This label connects to
                   # the service or any other k8 components
    # Let's define the container 
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: node_app
        image: jorge2091/eng130_jorge_nodejs # use the image that you built
        ports:
        - containerPort: 3000
```
